(in-package :kons-9)

#|
These demos assume that you have succeeded in loading the system and opening
the graphics window. If you have not, please check the README file.

Make sure you have opened the graphics window by doing:

(in-package :kons-9)
(run)

The PROCEDURAL-POLYGON class uses the kons-9 PROCEDURAL-MIXIN facility to
automatically update the shape when one of the input slots changes.

The demos below demonstrate this.

Note that if you change the points of an instance, currently they will be reset
if an input slot changes.
