A HEIGHTFIELD is a subclass of UV-MESH. It stores a height value (Y) for each
point on the XZ plane, representing the function Y=f(X,Z). It is useful for
visualizing mathematical functions of this sort, as well as terrain and
landscapes when combined with NOISE and TURBULENCE functions.

The demos below illustrate some examples of generating HEIGHTFIELD instances.

(Demo 01 heightfield) creating heightfields and setting point colors ===========

We use different formulas to set the height values of several heightfields. Then
we apply a variety of point colors.

Mix and match shapes and color schemes as desired.

(Demo 02 heightfield) animating a heightfield ==================================

We use an animator to vary the values of the heightfield formula over time.
