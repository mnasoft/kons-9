The ISOSURFACE class is a polyhedral mesh class which generates a surface at
a given threshold of a SCALAR-FIELD.

ISOSURFACE inherits from POLYHEDRON and internally creates polygonal (triangle)
faces. In this way it renders itself as a POLYHEDRON.

The demos below demonstrate examples of generating ISOSURFACE instances.

#|
(Demo 01 isosurface) basic field function ======================================

Use a custom field function with APPLY-FIELD-FUNCTION to set the values of
a SCALAR-FIELD. The field values fall off uniformly from the origin, resulting
in a spherical isosurface.
|#

         (iso (generate-isosurface (make-instance 'isosurface :field field :threshold 0.0))))
    (add-shape *scene* iso))
  )

#|
(Demo 02 isosurface) point source protocol =====================================

Use a point source (a POINT-CLOUD) with APPLY-FIELD-FUNCTION to set the values of
a SCALAR-FIELD. The POINT-SOURCE-FIELD-FN has a 1/r^2 falloff from its points.

Similar to Demo 02, but using custom field bounds and a random point source.
