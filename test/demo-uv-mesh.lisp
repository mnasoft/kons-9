The UV-MESH class is a polyhedral mesh class which is made up of a 2D array of
points. The mesh is parametrized in U and V, allowing for generation of shapes
using a variety of procedural techniques such as sweeps.

UV-MESH inherits from POLYHEDRON and internally creates polygonal faces from
its 2D array of points. In this way it renders itself as a POLYHEDRON.

The demos below demonstrate examples of generating UV-MESH instances.
